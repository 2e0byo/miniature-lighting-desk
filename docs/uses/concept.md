I imagined this functioning rather like a standard lighting
controller, only for stopmotion sets, controlling one or two lights,
as you did with batteries in Fydor.  However it could handle more: for
instance, a set of chritmas lights could be fashioned into
streetlamps, and turn on fitfully, like real lamps lighting up, by
scripting a ‘turn on’ program.  If you weren’t shooting in realtime
but could control the camera from the computer, each step in the
fitful turn-on could happen a few milliseconds before the shot is
taken, saving you from setting the manually (although I imagine this
kind of thing would probably be filmed in realtime).

Likewise, it could be used just as something to play with: for several
days it faded a string of lights on and off in a sinusoidal pattern in
the living room.  If you want, it would be possible to add the ability
to store patterns (of a limitied duration).

It could also be used for more exotic setups: one could attach a relay
controlling a mains light to a channel, although one could only turn
it on and off (and care must be taken when dealing with mains
electricity!).  It could drive some kinds of motors with speed
control.  It could drive small heating elements, though what you’d
want small heating elements for I don’t know.

Lastly, if you get bored, learning to program it is a fair
introduction to coding in Python, an easy and very versatile language
which is used everywhere.
